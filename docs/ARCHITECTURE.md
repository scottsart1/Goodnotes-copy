# Inkwell architecture

Inkwell is a single-module Android app (`:app`, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, minSdk 29,
target 35) optimised for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and S Pen. Package root:
`com.inkwell.notes`. Everything is local-first: Room database + files under
`filesDir/docs/` (see `core/storage/FileStore.kt`). AI is optional and bring-your-own-key.

## Build & verify

```bash
source /etc/profile.d/android-sdk.sh        # ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin            # fast compile check
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest             # JVM unit tests (app/src/test)
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug                 # full APK
```

There is no emulator in CI (no KVM). Verify with compilation and JVM unit tests; keep pure
logic (geometry, parsing, naming, serialization, request building) in plain Kotlin classes
so it is unit-testable without Android.

## Layers and contracts

| Package | What | Contract file(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `core/model` | Serializable data model shared by everything | `Documents.kt`, `Ink.kt`, `Tools.kt`, `Settings.kt`, `Ai.kt`, `Media.kt`, `Typed.kt` |
| `core/storage` | Room schema (`db/`), `FileStore`, `PageContentStore` (atomic ProtoBuf), `LibraryRepository` | `LibraryRepository.kt` |
| `core/naming` | `DateNaming` ("YYYYMMDD_Topic"), `AutoNamingService` | `AutoNamingService.kt` |
| `core/settings` | `SettingsRepository` (typed `AppSettings` JSON), `SecretStore` (Keystore AES-GCM) | — |
| `app` | `AppGraph` (service locator), navigation, `AppNavigator` | `AppGraph.kt`, `Navigation.kt` |
| `ink` | `InkCanvasView` (canvas engine), `PageRenderer` | `InkContracts.kt`, `InkCanvasView.kt`, `render/PageRenderer.kt` |
| `editor` | Notebook/PDF editor screen, toolbar, page management, split view | `EditorScreen.kt` |
| `library` | Home library, folders, trash | `LibraryScreen.kt` |
| `ai` | Providers, routing, usage/cost, chat panel, AI settings | `AiService.kt`, `ui/AiUi.kt` |
| `audio` | Recording service, playback, edge-docked recorder, transcripts | `AudioContracts.kt`, `ui/AudioUi.kt`, `RecordingService.kt` |
| `ocr` + `search` | ML Kit OCR + handwriting recognition, FTS index, indexing pipeline, search screen | `ocr/OcrContracts.kt`, `search/SearchScreen.kt` |
| `pdf` | Import, render, text extraction, merge/split/extract, scanning | `PdfService.kt` |
| `export` | Export formats, thumbnails, backup, sync to folder / notes vault, storage settings UI | `ExportContracts.kt`, `ui/ExportUi.kt` |
| `whiteboard`, `typed` | Infinite canvas screen, typed document editor | `WhiteboardScreen.kt`, `TypedDocumentScreen.kt` |
| `settings` | Settings screens, app lock | `SettingsScreen.kt`, `AppLock.kt` |
| `ui/theme` | Design tokens (`Inkwell.colors`, `Dimens`, Figtree type) | `Theme.kt` |
| `web/notes-vault` | Cloudflare Worker for yourpitbox.com/notes | `docs/VAULT_API.md` |

Rules for contracts:

1. **Public signatures in contract files are fixed.** Implement them; do not rename or remove.
   Adding new members (with defaults) is allowed when a feature needs it; mention it in your summary.
2. Implementations replace the `SCAFFOLD STUB` classes **in place, keeping the class name and
   constructor** (`XxxImpl(graph: AppGraph)`), so `AppGraph.kt` never needs editing.
3. Get collaborators lazily from the graph (`graph.library`, `graph.ai`, ...). Never construct
   another feature's implementation yourself.
4. `AppDatabase` (entities + DAOs) is shared. You may add queries to the DAO of your own
   feature; adding columns/entities is allowed only if essential (keep `version = 1`).
5. `app/build.gradle.kts` already declares every dependency. Do not add new libraries unless
   impossible otherwise.
6. `AndroidManifest.xml` already declares permissions, the recording service and the
   FileProvider (`${applicationId}.files`, paths in `res/xml/file_paths.xml`).

## UX principles (from the product brief)

- Handwriting first: minimal chrome, content over controls, small icons with ≥44dp targets,
  restrained light/dark themes from `ui/theme/Theme.kt`. No gradients, no emoji, Figtree type.
- The core experience must work offline and without any AI key.
- AI output never silently overwrites notes; insertion is always an explicit user action.
- Long work (OCR, AI, export, sync, transcription) runs off the main thread / in WorkManager
  and never blocks writing.
- API keys and the vault password live only in `SecretStore`; never log them, never put them
  in settings JSON, exports, or shared files.

## Threading

- UI on Main. Disk and network on `Dispatchers.IO`. CPU work on `Dispatchers.Default`.
- Background jobs use WorkManager (`androidx.work`) with unique work names per document.
- `AppGraph.appScope` for fire-and-forget work that must outlive a screen.
