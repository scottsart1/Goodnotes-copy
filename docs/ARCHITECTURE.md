# Inkwell architecture

Inkwell is a single-module Android app (`:app`, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, minSdk 29,
target 35) optimised for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and S Pen. Package root:
`com.inkwell.notes`. Everything is local-first: Room database + files under
`filesDir/docs/` (see `core/storage/FileStore.kt`). AI is optional and bring-your-own-key.

## Build & verify

```bash
source /etc/profile.d/android-sdk.sh        # ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin            # fast compile check
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest             # JVM unit tests (app/src/test)
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug                 # full APK
```

There is no emulator in CI (no KVM). Verify with compilation and JVM unit tests; keep pure
logic (geometry, parsing, naming, serialization, request building) in plain Kotlin classes
so it is unit-testable without Android.

| `web/notes-vault` | Cloudflare Worker for yourpitbox.com/notes | `docs/VAULT_API.md` |

Rules for contracts:

1. **Public signatures in contract files are fixed.** Implement them; do not rename or remove.
   Adding new members (with defaults) is allowed when a feature needs it; mention it in your summary.
2. Implementations replace the `SCAFFOLD STUB` classes **in place, keeping the class name and
   constructor** (`XxxImpl(graph: AppGraph)`), so `AppGraph.kt` never needs editing.
3. Get collaborators lazily from the graph (`graph.library`, `graph.ai`, ...). Never construct
   another feature's implementation yourself.
4. `AppDatabase` (entities + DAOs) is shared. You may add queries to the DAO of your own
   feature; adding columns/entities is allowed only if essential. A schema change bumps
   `version` with a non-destructive migration in `db/Migrations.kt` (see `MigrationSchemaTest`).
5. `app/build.gradle.kts` already declares every dependency. Do not add new libraries unless
   impossible otherwise.
6. `AndroidManifest.xml` already declares permissions, the recording service and the
   FileProvider (`${applicationId}.files`, paths in `res/xml/file_paths.xml`).

## UX principles (from the product brief)

- Handwriting first: minimal chrome, content over controls, small icons with ≥44dp targets,
  restrained light/dark themes from `ui/theme/Theme.kt`. No gradients, no emoji, Figtree type.
- The core experience must work offline and without any AI key.
- AI output never silently overwrites notes; insertion is always an explicit user action.
- Long work (OCR, AI, export, sync, transcription) runs off the main thread / in WorkManager
  and never blocks writing.
- API keys and the vault password live only in `SecretStore`; never log them, never put them
  in settings JSON, exports, or shared files.
- Voiceprints (speaker embeddings, reference clips) are biometric: encrypted, under
  `noBackupFilesDir`, never in the database, backups, exports or sync. Only names travel.

## Speaker identification

Runs after a recording, never live. `SpeakerPrefs.engine` picks the engine:

- **DEVICE** (default): `RecordingEngine` calls `SpeakerService.onRecordingFinished` and
  `speakers/work/DiarizationWorker` runs sherpa-onnx (pyannote segmentation 3.0 + WeSpeaker
  ResNet34-LM embeddings) over windows of up to 10 minutes, checkpointing after each. The two
  models (~32 MB) are downloaded once by `speakers/models/ModelDownloadWorker` from pinned
  Hugging Face revisions and verified by size and SHA-256. Window voices are linked across
  windows by embedding similarity (`ClusterLinker`), then matched to known people
  (`PersonMatcher`, calibrated scores in `VoiceScores`).
- **OPENAI**: `TranscriptionWorker` transcribes each 120 s segment with
  gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize, sending up to four 2-10 s reference clips (voices already heard in
  the recording, then known people from `SpeakerService.referencesFor`) so labels stay
  consistent across segments (`speakers/cloud`).
- **OFF**.

Storage: `recording_speakers` (one row per voice and recording, linked to `people`),
`speaker_turns` (who spoke when) and `transcript_segments.speakerLabel` + `speaker` (display
name, the field exports, search, the vault and AI prompts read). `TurnAligner` labels transcript
blocks by time overlap and splits long blocks at sentence boundaries. Naming, confirming,
moving a block, merging voices and renaming people all go through `SpeakerService`, which
rewrites names, re-indexes search and hands the transcript to sync. Voiceprints live in
`speakers/voices/VoiceprintStore` (AES-256-GCM, Keystore key `inkwell.voices.v1`).

## Threading

- UI on Main. Disk and network on `Dispatchers.IO`. CPU work on `Dispatchers.Default`.
- Background jobs use WorkManager (`androidx.work`) with unique work names per document.
- `AppGraph.appScope` for fire-and-forget work that must outlive a screen.
