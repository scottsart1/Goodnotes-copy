# Notes vault (yourpitbox.com/notes)

A private vault for the notes, meeting/lecture transcripts and audio that the Inkwell
Android app syncs. It is a Cloudflare Worker (TypeScript, no framework) with a D1 database
and an R2 bucket, mounted on `yourpitbox.com/notes*` and `www.yourpitbox.com/notes*`.

- **Invisible without the special link.** Everything except `/notes/<LINK_ID>` and the
  paths below it returns a plain `404 Not Found`, including `/notes` itself.
- **Link only, or a password on top.** With `NOTES_ACCESS = "link"` in `wrangler.toml`
  (the setting for this single-user vault) the private link alone opens the page and the
  API. Without it the page and the API also need a session created with the password.
- **Protocol:** [`docs/VAULT_API.md`](../../docs/VAULT_API.md) (the contract the app's
  sync client is written against).

## Bindings and secrets

| Name | Kind | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DB` | D1 binding | database `notes-vault` (id in `wrangler.toml`) |
| `FILES` | R2 binding | bucket `notes-vault-files` (bodies at `<docId>/<name>`) |
| `NOTES_LINK_ID` | Worker secret | the private path segment, e.g. 32 random URL-safe characters |
| `NOTES_ACCESS` | var (`wrangler.toml`) | `"link"`: the link alone opens the vault; anything else: link plus password |
| `NOTES_PASSWORD` | Worker secret | the vault password (not needed with `NOTES_ACCESS = "link"`) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Worker secret | HMAC key for session tokens |

None of the secrets are stored in this repository. If `NOTES_LINK_ID` is missing the
Worker answers 404 to everything.

## One-time setup

The D1 database `notes-vault` and the R2 bucket `notes-vault-files` already exist on the
Cloudflare account and the database id is in `wrangler.toml`. The deploy script still
checks for them (and creates them if they are ever missing) and applies the D1 migrations.

### 1. Cloudflare API token

Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → Custom token:

| Scope | Permission | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Account | Workers Scripts | Edit |
| Zone (`yourpitbox.com` only) | Workers Routes | Edit |
| Account | D1 | Edit |
| Account | Workers R2 Storage | Edit |
| Zone (`yourpitbox.com` only) | Zone | Read (lets wrangler resolve `zone_name` to the zone id) |

Account Resources: the account that owns `yourpitbox.com`. Zone Resources: Include →
Specific zone → `yourpitbox.com`. Copy the token; you also need the **Account ID**
(dashboard → Workers & Pages → right-hand side, or the URL of the account home).

### 2. Choose the password and generate the link id and session secret

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n=' | tr '+/' '-_' | cut -c1-32   # NOTES_LINK_ID
openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n'                               # SESSION_SECRET
```

Use a long passphrase for the password (the login is rate limited per IP, but the
password is the last line of defence once someone has the link).

### 3a. Deploy from GitHub Actions (recommended)

Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret, add:

`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `NOTES_LINK_ID`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and
`NOTES_PASSWORD` for password access (not needed with `NOTES_ACCESS = "link"`).

Then Actions → **Deploy notes vault** → Run workflow. From then on every push to `main`
that touches `web/notes-vault/**` runs typecheck, tests and the deploy. Without
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` the deploy job is skipped. In CI the script never generates a link
id: if `NOTES_LINK_ID` is not set and the Worker has none yet, it stops with an error.

### 3b. Or deploy from your computer

```bash
cd web/notes-vault
npm ci
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<account-id>   # or: npx wrangler login
export NOTES_PASSWORD='<your-password>'  # password access only; not needed with NOTES_ACCESS = "link"
export NOTES_LINK_ID=<link-id>         # optional; see below
export SESSION_SECRET=<session-secret> # optional; see below
npm run deploy                          # = bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

`scripts/deploy.sh` is idempotent:

1. lists D1 databases and creates `notes-vault` if missing; if `wrangler.toml` still has
   `database_id = "REPLACE_WITH_D1_ID"` it writes the real id in (and it refuses to deploy
   if the file names a different database than the account has);
2. creates the R2 bucket `notes-vault-files` if missing;
3. runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply notes-vault --remote`;
4. sets the secrets with `printf "%s" "$X" | npx wrangler secret put NAME`. `NOTES_PASSWORD`
   is required unless `wrangler.toml` sets `NOTES_ACCESS = "link"` (then an existing one is
   kept). If `NOTES_LINK_ID` / `SESSION_SECRET` are unset, existing values are kept;
   when the Worker has no link yet (first local run) a random 32-character id is generated
   and **the private URL is printed once** (even if a later step fails) - save it in your
   password manager;
5. runs `npx wrangler deploy` (routes `yourpitbox.com/notes*` and `www.yourpitbox.com/notes*`
   on the `yourpitbox.com` zone). There is no `workers.dev` or preview URL
   (`workers_dev = false`); test locally with `npx wrangler dev` (see Development).

## Using the vault

Open `https://yourpitbox.com/notes/<LINK_ID>` (bookmark it; `www.` redirects there).
With link-only access the notes show straight away. Anyone who has the link can read and
change them, so keep it to yourself the way you would a password. With password access,
enter the password and press **Unlock**. The session lasts 30 days on that browser, and
**Lock** signs out. The page lists synced documents (newest first) with search across titles, recognised
text and transcripts; selecting one shows the rendered notes, transcripts with clickable
`[mm:ss]` timestamps that seek the recording, and downloadable files.

### Changing the password

Update the `NOTES_PASSWORD` repository secret and re-run the workflow, or locally:

```bash
cd web/notes-vault
printf '%s' '<new-password>' | npx wrangler secret put NOTES_PASSWORD
```

Every existing session token (browsers and the app) stops working immediately, because
tokens carry a fingerprint of the password. Enter the new password in the app.

Switching `NOTES_ACCESS` from `"link"` to password access also invalidates every token
issued while the link alone opened the vault, so the link alone no longer gets in.

### Changing the link

Set a new `NOTES_LINK_ID` the same way. The old link turns into a plain 404 at once;
update the URL in the app and your bookmark. Rotating `SESSION_SECRET` signs everyone out.

## How the app connects

In Inkwell: **Settings › Storage, sync & backup › Your Pit Box vault**. Paste the private
URL (`https://yourpitbox.com/notes/<LINK_ID>`) and use *Test connection*.
- **Link-only vault:** leave the password empty. The app then calls the API with the link
  alone.
- **Password vault:** enter the password. The app stores it in its encrypted `SecretStore`,
  signs in with `POST {url}/api/session`, and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with
  every call. On `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` it signs in again. Choose per output (notes, transcripts,
audio) whether it goes to the vault.

Implementation details the client can rely on (all within `docs/VAULT_API.md`):

- File uploads (`PUT .../files/{name}`) stream straight into R2 and need a
  `Content-Length` header (`411 {"error":"length_required"}` otherwise; OkHttp sends it
  for file and byte-array bodies). `Content-Type` is stored and returned on download.
  Downloads support `Range` requests (206) so the browser can seek audio.
- A transcript or file uploaded before its document creates a placeholder document row
  (kind `NOTEBOOK`, the transcript title or the doc id as title) that the next
  `PUT /api/docs/{docId}` replaces.
- `PUT /api/docs/{docId}` replaces the whole record: optional fields that are omitted
  reset to their defaults (`folderPath` null, `pageCount` 0, `tags` [], `markdown` "").
- All PUTs and DELETEs are idempotent; DELETE of something missing returns `{"ok":true}`.
- Extra (not in the contract, harmless to ignore): `DELETE /api/docs/{docId}/transcripts/{recordingId}`.
- Errors are JSON `{"error": code}` (sometimes with `detail`): 400 `invalid_request` /
  `invalid_json`, 401 `invalid_password` / `unauthorized`, 403 `bad_origin`, 404
  `not_found`, 405 `method_not_allowed`, 411 `length_required`, 413 `too_large`, 429
  `locked` (+ `retryAfterSeconds`), 503 `not_configured`.

## Security notes

- The link id and password are compared in constant time (both sides SHA-256 hashed,
  then a byte loop without early exit).
- Token = `base64url(JSON {exp, pv}) + "." + base64url(HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_SECRET, payload))`,
  valid 30 days; `pv` = first 8 bytes (hex) of SHA-256(`NOTES_PASSWORD` + `SESSION_SECRET`),
  with `"link\0"` prefixed to the input in link-only mode.
- Cookie `nv_session`: `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/notes/<LINK_ID>; Max-Age=2592000`.
- Lockout: per client address (IPv6 per /64, from `CF-Connecting-IP`), after 8 failed
  logins within 15 minutes further attempts get 429 until the window ends; a successful
  login resets the counter. Attempts are counted atomically before the password check.
- CSRF: state-changing requests authenticated by the cookie must carry an `Origin` equal to
  the request's origin; bearer-token requests are exempt.
- Every response carries a strict CSP (per-response nonce, no inline handlers, no external
  scripts), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` (the URL
  contains the link id), `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`, `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Workers Logs / observability are disabled in `wrangler.toml` because request URLs contain
  the link id; the code never logs URLs, headers or bodies.
- Uploaded files are served as attachments with `nosniff` and the CSP, so an uploaded
  HTML file cannot run script on this origin.

## Limits

- `markdown` ≤ 2 MB (UTF-8). D1 rows are capped at 2,000,000 bytes, so markdown above
  1.5 MB is kept whole in R2 (`_markdown/<docId>.md`) and only its first 1.5 MB is searched.
- Files ≤ 95 MB (Cloudflare's request body limit is 100 MB on Free/Pro plans).
- Transcripts ≤ about 1.9 MB of segment JSON + text per recording.
- On the Workers Free plan (10 ms CPU per request) very large documents may hit the CPU
  limit; the paid plan has ample headroom.

## Development

```bash
cd web/notes-vault
npm install
npx tsc --noEmit
npx vitest run          # tests run inside workerd with local D1/R2 and fake secrets

# local server with fake values (never use real ones on the command line history):
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply notes-vault --local
npx wrangler dev --var NOTES_LINK_ID:dev-link --var NOTES_PASSWORD:dev-password --var SESSION_SECRET:dev-secret
# then open http://localhost:8787/notes/dev-link
```

Schema changes: add `migrations/000N_name.sql` and update `schema.sql` to match.
